Use this resource to create new custom policies (YAML) for the Bridgecrew platform <https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/incidents>.
For more details on this API see their online API documentation <https://docs.bridgecrew.io/reference/savepolicy>.





## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "bridgecrew_policy" "policy" {
   cloud_provider = "aws"
   severity       = "critical"
   category       = "logging"

   file = "${path.module}/policy/policy.yaml"

   guidelines = "This should explain a little"

   benchmarks {
     cis_aws_v12 = ["1.1", "2.1"]
   }

 }
```

## Importing existing Policies

You can import existing platform policies into Terraform code.

```
terraform import bridgecrew_policy.imported policyid
```

You can view the policy id, either by using the API docs policy list feature:
