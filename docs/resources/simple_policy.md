# bridgecrew_simple_policy

Use this resource to create new "simple" custom policies for the Bridgecrew platform <https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/incidents>.
For more details on this API see their online API documentation <https://docs.bridgecrew.io/reference/savepolicy>.





## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl


resource "bridgecrew_simple_policy" "new" {
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  title          = "Ensure that this title is meaningfully long (20 chars)"
  severity       = "critical"
  category       = "logging"
  frameworks     = ["Terraform"]

  // For now only one condition block is valid
  conditions {
    resource_types = ["aws_s3_bucket"]
    cond_type      = "attribute"
    attribute      = "bucket"
    operator       = "not_equals"
    value          = "jimbo2"
  }

  guidelines = "This should explain a lot more, in fact im padding this out to at least 50 characters"

  // although benchmarks take a free text this is total ***, as it needs to be an existing benchmark as
  // does the version, and that more like a category than anything
  benchmarks {
    cis_aws_v12 = ["1.1", "2.1"]
    cis_aws_v13 = ["1.3", "2.4"]
  }

}
```

## Importing existing Policies

You can import existing platform policies into Terraform code.

```
terraform import bridgecrew_simple_policy.imported mypolicyid
```

You can view the policy id, either by using the API docs policy list feature:

<https://docs.bridgecrew.io/reference/getcustompoliciestable> or by using the policies datasource.
